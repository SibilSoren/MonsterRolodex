# Monster Rolodex

### About this project 

This is a practice project done by me, to learn the basic concepts of React, This app is basically a list of user which is being fetched from a API which returns 10 random user data in a JSON and then displaying reach user data in form of card along with image which also fetched with different API displaying the Username, email. We can also filter users from a input box, which in realtime filters out the users present in the user list which is fetch from the API.
